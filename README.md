# weedmaps-blog

Weedmaps blog test.

Made with...

Meteor 1.3 RC.2
Flowrouter-ssr 3.12.1
React 0.14.7
TrackerReact 1.0.0

~Tracker needed to be brought back to 1.0.0 because 1.0.2 has bugs right now.~ Flowrouter is incompatible with Meteor 1.3 beta 16 + so Flowrouter-ssr 3.12.1 had to be used as well.


~Edit: I had the code to have the edit buttons reset and values pull. however I killed the commit as the TrackerReact bug caused serious issues which would of required a major code rework. Will look into fixing later this week.~

TrackerReact fixed.... Everything has been updated and working properly now.
